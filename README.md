Iteration 1:
In this iteration we completed the base of the project. The base classes were created and implemented. This includes the player class, game class, stopwatch class, and main function:
Player Class: Holds important attributes corresponding to a player such as their score and functions to set and get the score.
Game Class: Is the class that holds the elements of the game. This has 2 players of player class. It has functions to get and change the players and turns, as well as a a random generator and reset. 
Stopwatch class: Will handle the stopwatch, not implemented yet. Is planned for next iteration.
Main: runs the game for 5 turns and prints out results each turn.

In the next iteration we plan to implement the stopwatch and have a more interactive agme were the users are more involved.

The turns function still has some bugs, but works, and the stopwatch is still unusable.

We have made a bash script to run the game, so it should be intuitive.
